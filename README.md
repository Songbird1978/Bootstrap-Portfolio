# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

Professional Portfolio of work for Hayley Callender using HTML, CSS and media queries to create a responsive application with links to all professional accounts on social media and Github repositories of projects created. I wanted to create a streamlined and aesthetically pleasing portfolio. 

This portfolio uses a Bootstrap navbar / Grids, nested grids and project cards, therefore improving the responsiveness and reducing the amount of media queries that were needed. I think it tidies the earlier project up and the Navbar's appearance at smaller screen sizes is more appealling with the use of a hamburger toggle switch.
